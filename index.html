            <h2>Missile Man Of India </h2>
            <p>
                <b>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam,</b> often referred to as the "People's President" and the "Missile Man of India," was a renowned scientist, educator, and the 11th President of India. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam rose from humble beginnings to become a prominent figure in the field of aerospace engineering. His significant contributions to India's space and military programs, particularly his role in the development of ballistic missile technology, earned him widespread admiration. Dr. Kalam's leadership at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) propelled India into the league of nations with advanced space and defense capabilities. Beyond his scientific achievements, Kalam was a beloved teacher, inspiring countless students with his vision and passion for education. He served as the President of India from 2002 to 2007, leaving an indelible mark with his emphasis on youth empowerment, innovation, and national development. Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, but his legacy lives on as a symbol of perseverance, intellect, and dedication to the progress of the nation.</p>
